collecting coins are purely optional, collecting 60 will allow the blue gate to be destroyed, giving a powerup to shoot swords faster
all gates are destroyed by shooting swords at them if conditions have been met

-destroy boss by shooting swords at it like normal enemy
-lure boss's attacks into gate 10 times, breaking the gate and killing boss in process (gate flashes to indicate hit)
-kill the 'secret' blue enemy enemy in Room33A, which drops a key. Shooting at boss gate while holding pink key breaks gate, kills boss, wins game
